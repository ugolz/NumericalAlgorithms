# Numerical Algorithms
Project of UniVe's Numerical Algorithm course (a.y. 2020). <br>
For the epidemiological study, the project will refer only to the Marche region.<br>
For more detail, see the pdf files inside the projects

## Assignment 1

### Part 1
The first part of the assignment is about strain design. 
It were asked to study this problem using the approximation techniques studied during the course.

### Part 2
In this second part of the assignment were asked to use the studied approximation/interpolation techniques to evaluate the approximated function outside the interval of the available data
In particular the study of epidemiological data during the CoViD-19 pandemic in Italy.

## Assignment 2
The numerical integration methods used are:
* Forward Euler method
* Backward Euler method
* Crank-Nicholson method
* Built-in function ode45

### Part 1
In the second assignment we are asked to write a script implementing the studied numerical integration methods for the Couchy problem (CP) 
characterised by a system of nonlinearordinary differential equations.
The CP reffers to the spring equation.


### Part 2
In this second part of the assignment we will use the implemented code to solve the modified SIR model, i.e., the SEIARD model, 
to study the coronavirus pandemic in Italy.
